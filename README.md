##AI Tools Usage

DALL-E was used to generate custom images for the CyberShield website, enhancing its visual appeal with illustrations of security concepts. LogoDesign AI helped to create a unique logo that effectively communicates the website's identity. However, some images didn't fully align with the website's theme, requiring additional adjustments, along with further work for mobile and resolution optimization. 
Additionally, I utilized ChatGPT and GitHub Copilot for troubleshooting code, which streamlined the development process. These AI tools significantly improved my design approach, providing technical support for a more functional website. Although, I faced challenges when the AI tools’ suggestions were too generic, requiring adjustments to align with project goals. While Copilot was useful for debugging, it occasionally generated code that introduced minor bugs. To fix these, I also utilised online tutorials available on the W3Schools website, which provided valuable guidance. Overall, the combination of AI tools and online HTML and CSS resources proved effective in quickly resolving issues, enhancing productivity, and facilitating a smoother deployment process for the CyberShield website.


##Reflection on Development Process

###Challenges
I faced challenges with content positioning on the page, struggling to find an effective layout for the information. Additionally, I encountered some issues with the AI tools, requiring adjustments to ensure their outputs aligned with the project’s needs.
Final Thoughts
This project provided valuable insights into web development and design principles. I learned the importance of effective content positioning and layout for enhancing user experience. The process challenged me to think creatively about how to present information clearly and engagingly. Overall, the experience was rewarding and helped me refine my skills, resulting in a functional and visually appealing website that I’m proud of.
